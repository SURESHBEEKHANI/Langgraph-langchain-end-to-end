       "'Page: Burning Man\\nSummary: Burning Man is a week-long large-scale desert event focused on \"community, art, self-expression, and self-reliance\" held annually in the western United States. The event\\'s name comes from its culminating ceremony: the symbolic burning of a large wooden effigy, referred to as the Man, that occurs on the penultimate night, the Saturday evening before Labor Day. Since 1990, the event has been at Black Rock City in northwestern Nevada, a temporary city erected in the Black Rock Desert about 100 miles (160 km) north-northeast of Reno. According to Burning Man co-founder Larry Harvey in 2004, the event is guided by ten stated principles: radical inclusion, gifting, decommodification, radical self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation, and immediacy.\\nBurning Man features no headliners or scheduled performers; participants create all the art, activities, and events. Artwork includes experimental and interactive sculptures, buildings, performances, and art cars, among other media. These contributions are inspired by a theme chosen annually by the Burning Man Project. The event has been called \"countercultural revelry\" and described by its organizers as an \"excuse to party in the desert\". However, NPR said of Burning Man in 2019, \"Once considered an underground gathering for bohemians and free spirits of all stripes, Burning Man has since evolved into a destination for social media influencers, celebrities and the Silicon Valley elite.\"\\n\\nBurning Man originated on June 22, 1986, on Baker Beach in San Francisco as a small function organized by Larry Harvey and Jerry James, the builders of the first Man. It has since been held annually, spanning the nine days leading up to and including Labor Day. Over the event\\'s history, attendance has generally increased. In 2019, 78,850 people participated.\\nBurning Man is organized by the Burning Man Project, a nonprofit organization that, in 2013, succeeded Black Rock City LLC, a for-profit limited liability company. Black Rock City LLC was formed in 1999 to represent the event\\'s organizers and is now considered a subsidiary of the nonprofit organization. The Burning Man Project endorses multiple smaller regional events guided by the Burning Man principles in the United States and internationally.\\nThe film Stalker by Tarkovsky heavily influenced the Cacophony Society, which began in 1986 in the San Francisco Bay Area and which organized \"Zone Trips\" for participants.\\nThe first burning of a wooden, symbolic man at Black Rock Desert, Nevada, occurred on \"Zone Trip Number 4\" in 1990. This occasion evolved into an enormous annual festival of arts, music, and culture called Burning Man.\\n\\nPage: Resistance (video game series)\\nSummary: Resistance is a series of first-person shooter and third-person shooter video games developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita video game consoles. The series takes place in an alternate history 1950s, in which an alien civilization known as the Chimera have invaded and conquered Earth, expanding their armies by capturing humans and transforming them into monster-like super soldiers to fight for them. The player takes the role of one of the remaining human armed forces as they fight against the Chimera invasion. The series is noted for its use of both conventional and futuristic weaponry, reflecting Insomniac\\'s previous work on the Ratchet & Clank series.\\n\\nPage: Destroyed in Seconds\\nSummary: Destroyed in Seconds is an American television series that premiered on Discovery Channel on August 21, 2008.\\nHosted by Ron Pitts, it features video segments of various things being destroyed fairly quickly (hence, \"in seconds\") such as planes crashing, explosions, sinkholes, boats crashing, fires, race car incidents, floods, factories, etc. The nature of the show closely resembles Real TV.

      "Summary: The economy of Pakistan is categorized as a developing economy. It ranks as the 24th-largest based on GDP using purchasing power parity (PPP) and the 43rd largest in terms of nominal GDP. With a population of 254.4 million people as of 2024, Pakistan's position at per capita income ranks 161st by GDP (nominal) and 138th by GDP (PPP) according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n",
      "In its early years, Pakistan's economy relied heavily on private industries. The nationalization of a significant portion of the sector, including financial services, manufacturing, and transportation, began in the early 1970s under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. During Zia-ul Haq's regime in the 1980s, an \"Islamic\" economy was adopted, outlawing economic practices forbidden in Sharīʿah and mandating traditional religious practices. The economy started privatizing again in the 1990s.\n",
      "The economic growth centers in Pakistan are located along the Indus River; these include the diversified economies of Karachi and major urban centers in Punjab (such as Faisalabad, Lahore, Sialkot, Rawalpindi, and Gujranwala), alongside less developed areas in other parts of the country. In recent decades, regional connectivity initiatives such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have emerged as pivotal contributors to infrastructure and energy development, with long-term implications for economic stability. Pakistan was classified as a semi-industrial economy for the first time in the late 1990s, albeit an underdeveloped country with a heavy dependence on agriculture, particularly the textile industry relying on cotton production. Primary export commodities include textiles, leather goods, sports equipment, chemicals, and carpets/rugs.\n",
      "Pakistan is presently undergoing economic liberalization, including the privatization of all government corporations, aimed at attracting foreign investment and reducing budget deficits. However, the country continues to grapple with challenges such as rapid  population growth, widespread illiteracy, political instability,  hostile neighbors  and heavy foreign debt.\n",

      "Page: List of countries by GDP (nominal)\n",
      "Summary: Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year. Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\n",
      "Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n",
      "The rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire's output around 1916, which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier. Since China's transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation, the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China's economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021. Among others, India has also experienced an economic boom since the implementation of economic liberalisation in the early 1990s.\n",
