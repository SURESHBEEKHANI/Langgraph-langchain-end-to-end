# langgraph-LangChain-end-to-end

This repository contains end-to-end examples and experiments with LangGraph, LangChain, and agentic AI patterns. It includes Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and supporting files for building, debugging, and experimenting with agent-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), custom agents, and conversational AI workflows.

## Project Structure

- `agent_based_rag/` — Notebooks for agentic RAG, corrective/self-RAG, and SQL agents with LangGraph.
- `Agent_From_Scratch/` — Building a ReAct agent from scratch in Python.
- `Agentic AI With Langgraph And MCP/` — Demos, debugging tools, and MCP server/client examples.
- `chatbot_with_langgraph/` — Chatbot implementations using LangGraph.
- `different_structure_pattern/` — Experiments with agent structure and human-in-the-loop patterns.
- `langchain-components/` — LangChain memory, RAG, and chatbot examples.
- `langgraph_from_scratch/` — LangGraph implementation from scratch.
- `Pre-requist_for_langgraph/` — Prerequisite notebooks and agent/tool practice.
- `data/` — Example data files.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Langgraph-langchain-end-to-end
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - For the main project:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - For specific submodules (e.g., `Agentic AI With Langgraph And MCP` or `langchain-components`), see their respective `requirements.txt` files.

3. **Run Jupyter notebooks:**
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Run Python scripts:**
   ```bash
   python path/to/script.py
   ```

## Notes
- This project is for educational and experimental purposes.
- Some notebooks/scripts may require API keys or additional setup (see notebook comments).
